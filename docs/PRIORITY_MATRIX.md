## ❌ EXPLICITLY SKIP (Not Worth It for Retail)

| Feature | Why Skip |
|---------|----------|
| Tick-level data | $1000s/month, only for HFT |
| Bloomberg Terminal | $24k/year, unnecessary |
| Proprietary data feeds | Expensive, marginal value |
| Ultra-low latency (<10ms) | Can't compete with institutional HFT |
| Perfect survivorship bias correction | Manual tracking of 30 delistings is good enough |
| Order book depth modeling | Slippage models sufficient |
| GPU clusters | Single GPU or CPU is fine |
| Real-time news APIs | Expensive, low signal for retail |

## Next Steps (If Starting Today)

### Week 1-2: Walk-Forward Testing
```python
# Create src/validation/walk_forward.py
# Add out_of_sample_sharpe to database schema
# Update ResearchEngine to include walk-forward phase
# Test on 3+ years of BTC data
```

### Week 3-4: Parameter Stability
```python
# Create src/validation/stability_test.py
# Perturb strategy parameters ±10%
# Reject strategies with >50% Sharpe degradation
```

### Week 5-6: Complete ML Training
```python
# Fix src/agents/ml_quant_agent.py:373-417

## Key Insight

**You're 70% done with a serious retail quant platform.**

**The missing 30% is achievable in 12-18 months with <$100/month budget.**

**Start with walk-forward testing. Everything else is useless if strategies are overfitted.**
